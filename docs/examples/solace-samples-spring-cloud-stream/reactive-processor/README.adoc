Spring Cloud Stream Reactive Processor Basic Sample
==================================================

This sample is one of the original Spring Cloud Stream samples that was hand-picked to demonstrate the link:https://github.com/SolaceProducts/spring-cloud-stream-binder-solace[Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder]. The original source for this sample can be found link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-samples/tree/master/processor-samples/reactive-processor[here].

In this *Solace Spring Cloud Stream* sample, the application demonstrates basic reactive processing.

## Requirements

To run this sample, you will need to have installed:

* Java 8 or Above

## Running the application

The following instructions assume that you have the credentials for a real Solace PubSub+ service.

* Put your Solace credentials in the link:src/main/resources/application.yml[application.yml] file
* Go to the application root
* `./mvnw clean package`
* `java -jar target/reactive-processor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

The main application contains the reactive processor that receives textual data for a duration and aggregates them.
It then sends the aggregated data through the outbound destination of the processor.

The application also provides a source and sink for testing.
Test source will generate some text every second and the test sink will verify that the processor has accumulated the text over a duration.
Test source is bound to the same broker destination where the processor is listening from.
Similarly test sink is bound to the same broker destination where the processor is producing to.

You will see output similar to the following on the console every 5 seconds.

```
Data received: foobarfoobarfoo
Data received: barfoobarfoobar
Data received: foobarfoobarfoo
Data received: foobarfoobarfoo
```
